This is Rivet/CGI.  It is useful for running Rivet applications as a normal
process instead of under mod_rivet.  The bulk of this code was written by
Mr. David Welton as part of the orginal Rivet project.

The CGI integration was done by Mr. Roy Keene <rivet@rkeene.org>

This package is maintained by Mr. Roy Keene, not Mr. David Welton.
